# friendFinder

### Overview

This friendFinder app is a full-stacck site that will use Express to handle routing betweeen the survey page, the home page, and the api page. 

It will utilize Heroku to deploy.

## Issues for the TA

I was not able to get the fundamental logic to work. I tried to google some examples of it working and wasn't able to fully implement what I learned. 

I had issues parseInt-ing the newFriend scores so that they would be helpful in the math.

Printing to the survey page was also unable to be completed. I was able to collect a name and a photo but not able to get the modal to successfully work.
